									<h2 class="major">Healthcare</h2>
									<p>
										There is currently a shortage of healthcare professionals in Nevada. This severely limits the primary care coverage provided to Nevadans. Currently, there are only about 170 licensed Allopathic Physicians per 100,00 people living in Nevada. In addition, insurance rates are getting higher, which is obviously problematic for low-income families.

									<p>
										In Nevada, a person is killed by a firearm approximately every 20 hours. This is especially true in Las Vegas, nicknamed “Sin City”. In 2017, Las Vegas, a mass shooting at Mandalay Bay killed 61 people, and injured over 800 people. Nevada is one of the 21 states where gun deaths exceed motor vehicle-related deaths. Guns have become a serious concern among all Americans.

										"From large cities to rural communities, nowhere is immune from this epidemic" "We need action and we need leadership that will restore the assault weapons ban," she says. This year more children have died at school than have service members on the battlefield, she adds. "Instead of promoting real solutions, he is pushing to arm teachers for the benefit of gun manufacturers" "Republican leaders and the gun lobby cannot ignore these tragedies any longer," Titus says of President Trump. "Every day our friends, family members, and neighbors are dying from preventable gun violence"

										Dina Titus works in Washington, D.C. to ensure that every level of government has the resources needed to keep the public safe. The first emergency “funding bill” that they passed has provided resources to public health facilities, funding to develop a vaccine, and loans for small businesses. Then they passed the “Families First Coronavirus Response Act” to make sure that all coronavirus tests are free and expand unemployment benefits, nutritional assistance and leave. Now she’s working with my colleagues to pass a long-term recovery package.
